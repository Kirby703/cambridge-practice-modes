# cambridge-practice-modes
Repository for Kirby703's custom modes in [Cambridge](https://github.com/MillaBasset/cambridge).

## How to use
Download the source code ZIP from [here](https://github.com/Kirby703/cambridge-practice-modes/archive/main.zip).

Once done, extract the modes into one of these directories, depending on how you're running Cambridge:

* If you're running the game through a .exe, extract them into `%APPDATA%\cambridge\tetris\modes\`.
* If you're running the game through a .love on Windows, extract them into `%APPDATA%\LOVE\cambridge\tetris\modes\`.
* If you're running the game on Mac, extract them into `/Users/user/Library/Application Support/LOVE/cambridge/tetris/modes/`.
* If you're running the game on Linux, extract them into `~/.local/share/love/cambridge/tetris/modes`.
* If you're running the game from the source code, extract them into `tetris/modes/` in the folder you installed Cambridge to.
